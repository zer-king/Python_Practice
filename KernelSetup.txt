Jupyter notebooks in VS Code needs the virtual environment to be registered as a kernel, not just activated in the terminal.
Here’s how to fix it:

Why Activation Alone Isn’t Enough
- Activating  sets the environment for your terminal.
- But Jupyter needs a kernel spec to recognize and list it in the notebook interface.

Step 1: Activate Your Virtual Environment
Open your terminal and activate your virtual environment. 
For Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
For macOS/Linux:  
source venv/bin/activate
Step 2: Install ipykernel in Your Virtual Environment
Make sure you have ipykernel installed in your virtual environment. Run:
pip install ipykernel
Step 3: Register the Virtual Environment as a Jupyter Kernel
Run the following command to register your virtual environment:
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=venv --display-name "Python (venv)"
Replace your_env_name with a name you choose for the kernel.
Step 4: Restart VS Code
Close and reopen VS Code to ensure it picks up the new kernel.
Step 5: Select the New Kernel in Your Jupyter Notebook
Open your Jupyter notebook in VS Code.
Click on the kernel name in the top right corner of the notebook interface.
Select "Python (your_env_name)" from the list of available kernels.
